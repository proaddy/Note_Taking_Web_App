we can add any number of files and folders to it.
The blue box is where we change the note's content.

It is only a text-based note-taking application.

It is built in React.js and only has a single page. features such as deleting, and adding notes, folders, and subfolders work fine.

It doesn't work online and needs a remote/local storage place for the MongoDB server or you can use the MongoDB atlas to store the data online.
